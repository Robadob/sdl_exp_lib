# sdl_exp_lib
aka SEL. This repo will hopefully become the future of [sdl_exp](https://github.com/Robadob/sdl_exp), providing the same functionality in a more friendly lib format. It is intended that classes will be progressively moved to this project as they are refactored.

The original [sdl_exp](https://github.com/Robadob/sdl_exp) project was started by [@ptheywood](https://github.com/ptheywood) as a simple wrapper to SDL2 for use rendering data within his PhD. [@robadob](https://github.com/Robadob) eventually forked the project and became the new master branch, developing the majority of modern functionality.

Still waiting for @ptheywood to include his X-Input handling from a now rather deprecated private fork.
